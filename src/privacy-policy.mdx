# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: September 2, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Embedded ("the Bot," "we," or "us") collects, uses, stores, and protects user information when you interact with the Bot on Discord. By using the Bot, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

We interact with but do not collect the following types of information when you interact with the Bot:

- **User Data**: Only Discord IDs are collected for debugging purposes. No other personal information is collected.
- **Messages**: Content of messages you send to the Bot or in channels where the Bot is active, since it is required for its functionality (e.g., for detecting links).

We do not collect personal information beyond what is necessary for the Bot's operation, and we do not access any more than required for proper functionality.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information to:

- Provide and improve the Bot's functionality, such as processing failed URLs.
- Ensure the Bot operates securely and efficiently.
- Respond to support requests or inquiries.

We do not share, sell, or disclose your information to third parties, or use any data to train on AI/language models.

## 3. Data Storage and Security

- **Storage**: Data is stored securely on cloud providers' servers and retained only for as long as necessary to provide the Bot's services.
- **Security**: We implement reasonable measures to protect your data, such as encryption and access controls. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 4. Data Retention

We retain data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy. For example:

- Command logs may be retained temporarily to troubleshoot issues.
- Server settings are stored.

If you wish to have your data deleted, please contact me at \_sam100 on Discord.

## 5. Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Request access to the data we have collected about you.
- Request deletion of your data.
- Opt out of certain features that involve data collection by not using those commands or removing the Bot from your server.

To exercise these rights, contact me at \_sam100 on Discord.

## 6. Third-Party Services

The Bot operates on Discord's platform, and your use of Discord is subject to [Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of Discord or other third-party services the Bot may interact with.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the Bot's functionality or legal requirements. The updated policy will be posted here with the effective date. Continued use of the Bot after changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.
